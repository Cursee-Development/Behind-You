## Behind You!

*No escape!*

Look out for mobs that *creep* up on you! **Behind You** is a simple QoL mod that gives players a head-up when monsters are behind them! The messages are handled from the server, so even vanilla clients can enjoy this as part of your experience! As an added feature, **texts sent to the player are randomized like the splash text on Minecraftâ€™s title screen!** You can add your own by modifying `config/behind_you.txt`.

This mod was created for [NeoForge's 2025 Serverside Summer ModJam](https://neoforged.net/news/2025serversidesummer/), if you want to see this mod ported to other versions of Minecraft feel free to leave a comment.

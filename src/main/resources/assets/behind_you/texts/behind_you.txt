Behind you!
Look out!
Watch out!
Danger close!
Turn around!
Too late...
Run now!
No escape!
Right there!
Don't turn around...
It's behind you.
You just missed it...
Right behind you!
You can hear breathing...
The shadows move...
Too quiet...
Getting closer...
You heard that step, right?
Something moves behind you.
A faint whisper calls...
A chill runs down your spine.
You feel eyes on you.
Don’t breathe...
It’s watching.
Dead silence...
Back off!
Hide now!
It’s too close!
Your neck prickles...
You hear your heartbeat.
No way out...
A shadow looms...
Haunting steps echo...
One more step...
It’s lurking...
Don’t blink.
Keep moving...
Feet dragging behind you...
You’re never alone.
Its smile widens...
It’s reaching for you.
Did it whisper your name?
A presence is felt.
You’re trapped...
Doom nears.
It’s real.
Last chance!
Face it...
You know what’s behind you.
Too late to run.
The whispers grow louder...
The darkness moves...
Just keep running...
It knows.
A scream caught in your throat...
Breathe faster...
You're not alone...
